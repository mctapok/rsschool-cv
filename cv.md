## code examples:
### 6 kyu Multiples of 3 or 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
```javascript
function solution(number){
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
          sum = sum+i
        } if (number < 0){
          return 0;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```
